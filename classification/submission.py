        Adding constraints to enforce prerequisite. A course can have multiple

        requested course has additional prerequisites that are also being
        requested, these courses will be added to req.prereqs. You will be notified
        with a message when this happens. Also note that req.prereqs apply to every
        single course in req.cids. If a course C has prerequisite A that is requested
        together with another course B (i.e. a request of 'A or B'), then taking B does
        not count as satisfying the prerequisite of C. You cannot take a course
        in a quarter unless all of its prerequisites have been taken before that
        quarter. You should take advantage of get_or_variable().
